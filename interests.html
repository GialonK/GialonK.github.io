                    It feels a bit weird to talk about my academic/professional interests here. Therefore, I'll
                    just mention that I find theoretical computer science, algorithm design, and robotics (specifically intelligent
                    coordination and planning) to be particular fields of interest.

                    Outside of that, I occasionally watch movies/tv, play piano, and cook, the usual. I also
                    listen to a decent amount of music. There are various pages here that delve into those topics, but most of 
                    my interests will be laid out below.x
