                        As I'm a math/cs major, it is probably unsurprising that I enjoy Mathematics and 
                        Computer Science.

                        Currently, I really enjoy learning about quantum computation and am doing research
                        in the <a href="http://www.ozone.ri.cmu.edu/">Intelligent Coordination and Logistics Laborartory </a>
                        (note that the site is a bit outdated) as part of NASA HOME team at Carnegie Mellon. We're
                        working to develop a task planning/scheduling framework for managing ongoing maintenance
                        and repairs of a deep space habitat, which is pretty neat.

                        Outside of more purely academic interests, I really like puzzle hunts! However, I don't do very many
                        as they're a bit tiring. I also occasionally watch movies/tv, play games, and cook, the usual. Another large
                        part of my life revolves around music <a href="https://www.mikailokashabass.com/">(check out my brother, Mikailo!)</a>
                        as I play piano and just enjoy listening to stuff in general. I'll probably link some things I'm currently listening to below,
                        at some point.
