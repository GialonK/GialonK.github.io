                    <p>
                        I think this might be the first semester since freshman fall
                        where I'm starting the year without feeling overwhelmed. I didn't
                        necessarily have that many units/courses in spring 2019 but
                        due to various reasons it was not super enjoyable. Sophomore year was also particularly
                        intense due to overloading and my courses, but I think that because of the work put in then,
                        I'm now able to relax a little bit more and do things I want to without
                        excessive stress. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So with that being said I'm excited for this semester! I'm
                        taking courses in TCS, math, and systems that seem pretty interesting.
                        Because of this, I am finally able to invest more time into my classes,
                        hopefully allowing me to learn and retain more, which is always good. We will see though, I tend to
                        be overly optimistic at the start of the semester. I'm also doing research in robotics
                        this semester which should be interesting, although the scope of the project
                        is pretty unspecified as of right now. But exciting nonetheless.

                        I think it also might be more worthwhile for me to write more since just in
                        making this small entry, I've had to correct my spelling multiple times
                        due to various abbreviations and whatnot that I tend to use via text and other mediums.
                        Also, on a mildly related note, I am now all settled in to my apartment so I may
                        update this site more, although that remains to be seen. Anyhow, that's all
                        for now I think.
