                <h4>Summer 2019</h4><br>
                <p>
                This summer, I was a research assistant at the
                <a href="http://www.casos.cs.cmu.edu/index.php">Center for Computational
                Analysis of Social and Organizational Systems (CASOS)</a> at Carnegie Mellon University.
                I conducted descriptive social network analysis, where I used a variety of network analysis
                techniques and natural language processing to analyze Twitter data pertaining to the 2018 US
                Midterm election. From this data, I extracted various subgroups and meta-networks and analyzed their
                network structure and agents so as to determine key actors within each group, further looking at
                the nature of the interactions between agents, gaining a better understanding
                of the conversational dynamics that took place on Twitter during this time period.
